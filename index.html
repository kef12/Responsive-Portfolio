            Hi there! My name is Katherine Fleming and I live in Fort Collins, Colorado. I am currently attending the University of Denver (DU) Coding Bootcamp in hopes of becoming a full-stack developer.
            My professional background is in marketing and communications, with an emphasis in political consulting. Once I graduate from the DU Coding Bootcamp, I hope to be able to market myself as a political
            consultant/strategist that can provide my clients with a one-stop-shop for all their communications, marketing and web development needs.
            <br>
            <br>
            When I'm not studying or working, I enjoy hitting the gym and going on morning runs (I am in the process of training for a marathon that will take place in early April). I also cherish the time I get to spend with my fiance√© and our dog, Berlin.
            We love the outdoors and always take Berlin along on our hiking, mountain biking and fly fishing adventures; she even makes a pretty good climbing partner, although she will lay claim to the bouldering mat when we're not watching.
